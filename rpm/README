The RPM spec file supports building a package for RHEL / CentOS
version 5, 6 and 7. To do so, it uses tests on the version, provided
by the %{rhel} macro. This macro, and the %{dist} macro are not set by
default on RHEL / CentOS 5.

To build the package on RHEL / CentOS 5, use the following command
line to define the missing macros:

    rpmbuild --define 'rhel 5' --define 'dist .el5' -ba temboard-agent.spec
